                <p>For improve the performance of reaact application we need to Keep component state local where necessary.Code-splitting in React using dynamic import().Windowing or list virtualization in React which means if we load only the data which users want to see then the perfomance do better.As image loading is time consumimg.so we need to try using less image..</p>

                <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold'>  How does prototypical inheritance work?</h1>
                <p>The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. </p>

            <div className='mt-5'>
                <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold'> Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you do not set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts</h1>
                <p>If we update state directly calling the setState it may just replace the update we made.When we directly update the state, it does not change this.state immediately. Instead, it creates a pending state transition, and accessing it after calling this method and this will only return the present value.Thus we will lose control of the state across all components.</p>

                <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold'> You have an array of products. Each product has a name, price, description, etc. How will you implement a search to find products by name?</h1>
                <p>If we want to implement a search to find a product we can use
                    if (array.filter(evenet aroow event.name === 'name').length greater than 0) where array is the array name and name is the name which we want to find.

                <h1 className='text-2xl font-semibold'> What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?</h1>
                <p> Unit testing ensures that all code meets quality standards before itâ€™s deployed. This ensures a reliable engineering environment where quality is paramount. Over the course of the product development life cycle, unit testing saves time and money, and helps developers write better code, more efficiently.
